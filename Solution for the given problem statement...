--A. Customer Nodes Exploration
--1) How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT node_id)
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;

--2) What is the number of nodes per region?
SELECT r.region_id, r.region_name, 
COUNT(*) AS node_count
FROM data_bank.regions r
JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes n
    ON r.region_id = n.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id, r.region_name
ORDER BY region_id;

--3) How many customers are allocated to each region?
SELECT region_id, 
COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id
ORDER BY region_id;


--4) How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
--here we are using the recursive function 
WITH node_diff AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date,
    end_date - start_date AS diff
  FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
  WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date
  ORDER BY customer_id, node_id
  ),
sum_diff_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, node_id, SUM(diff) AS sum_diff
  FROM node_diff
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id)

SELECT 
ROUND(AVG(sum_diff),3) AS avg_reallocation_days
FROM sum_diff_cte;



select * from regions
select * from customer_nodes
select * from customer_transactions
--B. Customer Transactions
--1) What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
SELECT txn_type, 
COUNT(*),SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type

--2) What is the average total historical deposit(deposit transactions) counts and amounts for all customers?


----Firstly, find the count of transaction and average transaction amount for each customer.
 WITH deposits AS (
  SELECT customer_id, txn_type, 
    COUNT(*) AS txn_count, 
    AVG(txn_amount) AS avg_amount
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, txn_type)
	
--Then, find the average of both columns where the transaction type is deposit.
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(txn_count)) AS avg_deposit, 
  ROUND(AVG(avg_amount)) AS avg_amount
FROM deposits
WHERE txn_type = 'deposit';
